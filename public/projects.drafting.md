## [CS 275 Statics Simulator](https://github.com/jaywunder/CS-275-Statics-Simulator)
Semester group project for the Android class at UVM. This in app to help first year statics students gain intuition for how beams bend in different scenarios.  In this project I learned how to use the android API for multithreading, graphics, and user interfaces. I also honed my social skills in this class by taking the role of team lead in this project and being the main communicator between my group and the project stakeholder.



## [rust-lisp](https://github.com/jaywunder/rust-lisp)

This is an attempt to make a programming language from scratch by myself. I had not taken a compilers or interpreters course so I learned from tutorials online. I implemented functions and if statements, as well as some basic arithmetic and printing functionality.  I learned about 



CS 202 Compiler Construction

## [Jarsec Verified](https://github.com/jaywunder/jarsec-verified)
Final project for CS 295 Software Verification. Made an implementation of the Haskell parsing library ‚Äúparsec‚Äù in the proof assistant language Agda. Then modeled context free grammars (CFG‚Äôs) and proved the completeness of parsec‚Äôs ability to parse anything CFG‚Äôs can parse.



## [UVM Schedule Builder](https://jwunder.w3.uvm.edu/schedule-builder/public/index.php/home)
I was Schedule builder built for UVM CEMS school using react. Previously closed source, now available [here](https://github.com/jaywunder/schedule-builder)



## [hapi-sleep](https://github.com/jaywunder/hapi-sleep)

plugin for hapi to generate an insomnia workspace at start time. This plugin exposes an endpoint /insomnia that returns an insomnia import/export JSON string. This plugin is meant to be used by importing from a link in insomnia.

## [stutter.js](http://github.com/jaywunder/stutter.js)

My own LISP dialect written in javascript. Features object literals, array literals, funky strings, logic, and functions!  Not a finished product, but I had fun.



# Learning new tech and algorithms

## [Mastermind](/mastermind-front/)
Implementation of the mastermind board game using react and rust wasm.  Frontend made by me, [backend by Curtis Wilcox](https://github.com/quillcox/Mastermind)

## [Sudoku Solver](https://github.com/jaywunder/sudoku)
A sudoku solver using the backtracking algorithm written in rust

## [Otek](https://github.com/jaywunder/otek)

Otek is a command line tool to help you make new projects with ease.  Otek stores templates of projects so you don‚Äôt have to remake the same file structure every time your start developing a new idea. Just make the template once and keep getting started from that. Otek avoids being opinonated because the user knows what project format is best.
