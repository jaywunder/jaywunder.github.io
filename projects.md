### [Tap Tap Pop!](/tap-tap-pop)
#### A clone of "Pop the Lock" for my senior passages project about artificial intelligence. \n Currently there's no AI playing on the public version. I might make a scoreboard soon in the future...

### [Forest Fire](/forest-fire)
#### A cellular automaton using the 🌲 🍂 🍁 🔥 emojis to simulate a forest repeatedly growing and burning down

### [stutter.js](http://github.com/jaywunder/stutter.js)
#### My own LISP dialect written in javascript. Features object literals, array literals, funky strings, logic, and functions!  Not a finished product, but I had fun.
