### [Tap Tap Pop!](/tap-tap-pop)
####A clone of "Pop the Lock" for my senior passages project about artificial intelligence.
####Currently there's no AI playing on the public version. I might make a scoreboard
####soon in the future...

### [stutter.js](http://github.com/jaywunder/stutter.js)
#### My own LISP dialect written in javascript. Features object literals, array literals,
#### funky strings, logic, and functions!  Not a finished product, but I had fun.
