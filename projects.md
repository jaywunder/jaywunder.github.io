### [Breakout](/breakout)

#### A clone of the game "Breakout" for the Atari.  I made this game for machine learning research, I'm going to make a neural network learn how to play breakout.

### [Vector Field Visualizer](/vector-field)

#### A visualizer for vector fields.  Just enter the equation for `dy/dx` and watch it refresh.

### [Tap Tap Pop!](/tap-tap-pop)

#### A clone of "Pop the Lock" for my senior passages project about artificial intelligence. Currently there's no AI playing on the public version. I might make a scoreboard soon in the future...

### [Forest Fire](/forest-fire)

#### A cellular automaton using the 🌲 🍂 🍁 🔥 emojis to simulate a forest repeatedly growing and burning down

### [stutter.js](http://github.com/jaywunder/stutter.js)

#### My own LISP dialect written in javascript. Features object literals, array literals, funky strings, logic, and functions!  Not a finished product, but I had fun.
