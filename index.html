    I'm a sophomore at the University of Vermont interested in programming, entrepreneurism, and education.  I have experience with Javascript, Python, Java, HTML/CSS, and I'm dabbling in Rust.

    I'm now the president of the Computer Science club at UVM, and I was the head of coding on my high school's robotics team.
