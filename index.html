    I'm a high school student interested in code, robotics, and education.  I have experience with Javascript, Python, Java, HTML/CSS, and I'm dabbling in Rust.

    I teach Tynker programming and Lego robotics to elementary schoolers, and javascript to highschoolers on my robotics team.

    On this website you'll find my blog where I write idle thoughts and post papers from school that I especially like.  The Projects page is a list of my favorite/most complete projects.  To find a more complete list, go to <a href="https://github.com/jaywunder">my github page</a>.
