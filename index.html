    I'm a high school senior interested in code, robotics, and education.  I have experience with Javascript, Python, Java, HTML/CSS, and I'm dabbling in Rust.

    I teach Tynker programming and Lego robotics to elementary school students, and javascript to highschool students on my robotics team.
